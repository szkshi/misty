(This change log includes notes from in release 1.0.0, which failed to specify
them.)

- [ADD] Config now honors setters on trait methods.

- [ADD] Method Container::lazy() for general-purpose lazy params (i.e.,
  any param can now be lazy, not just services and class instantiations.)

Special thanks to Yuya Takeyama for working on the documentation, along with
Akihito Koriyama and Michal Amerek.
